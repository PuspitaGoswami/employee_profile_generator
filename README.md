# employee_profile_generator

This is a command-line application that generates a team profile HTML file based on user input. The application prompts the user to enter information about a manager, engineers, and interns on the team. The user can add multiple engineers and interns to the team. Once the user is finished entering team information, the application generates an HTML file that displays the team members' information in a nicely formatted way.
